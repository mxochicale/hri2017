Review Criteria: Review requirements and criteria are summarized below. Please thoroughly read through this information before starting the review.

Reviews are due on December 18, 2016. This is a hard deadline.

Conflict of interest: To ensure objectivity in the review process, we ask you to please disqualify yourself from submitting a review in any of the following situations:
1. Paper(s) you co-authored
2. Employment at the same institution or company
3. Co-authorship with authors in the last 24 months
4. Active collaboration on a project or serving as co-investigators on a grant
5. Graduate advisee/advisor relationship

As we are following a double-blind review process for HRI 2017, whether or not you have a conflict with a paper might not be clear. If you suspect that you have a conflict, please contact the chairs, Hirotaka Osawa [osawa@iit.tsukuba.ac.jp]
 or Laurel Riek [lriek@eng.ucsd.edu]


Reviewing responsibilities: Your primary responsibility as an HRI LBR reviewer is to provide clear feedback to authors, so that their future work may be accepted either at either this conference, or improved for acceptance at future conferences. While reviewing, please remember that LBR submissions may be work in progress. Some submissions may not be fully mature, or may simply be conceptual in nature. We want to encourage novel and thought provoking HRI research, and be encouraging to others. While this feedback does include some judgments, improving the quality of work in the community through constructive feedback is valued over reviewing for purely quality control. Given the interdisciplinary nature of HRI, it is important that your review both helps the chairs form an excellent program and inspires authors of rejected papers to improve and resubmit to HRI in the future. Towards this goal, reviewers for HRI have the following responsibilities:

* Evaluating the technical quality of the submission and the significance of its contributions to HRI,
* Keeping submissions confidential,
* Providing reviews in a timely manner,
* Authoring reviews that are concrete and informative for the LBR chairs and constructive and actionable for the authors.

Reviews that do not meet these requirements may be deemed as unjustified and dismissed by the Program Committee.

Feedback Comments

What suggestions do you have for improving this paper? Please provide concrete and actionable suggestions to help the authors.


This are my suggestions:
(1) It would be useful for the readers to show the positions of the robot and humans 
besides the heat map in order to have a better understanding positions.
(2) The use of English at the analysis section requires to be polished,
particularly for the variable description of HR and RT.  You can use a simple notation, for instance only \THETA_H and \THETA_R.
(3) Similar advice for the result section. The description of the outcomes B and C are not well explained. Also, It would be worthwhile to describe IN NI NN and NR prior to its use in the text
in order to easily follow the explanation in this section. 
(4) To have better description of the experiment, it is suggested to adding 
the number of participants and the robot's brand used in the experiment.
(5) Conclusions, there is little coherence for the last two sentences.
