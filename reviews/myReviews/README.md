# REQUIREMENTS FOR HRI REVIEWERS:

1. Conflict of interest for submissions
Please make sure that you do not have a conflict of interest with authors of a submission, as defined:

  (1) Paper(s) you co-authored
  (2) Employment at the same institution or company
  (3) Co-authorship with authors in the last 24 months
  (4) Active collaboration on a project or serving as co-investigators on a grant
  (5) Graduate advisee/advisor relationship

2. Problems
Please contact us immediately if any problems arise (such as difficulty downloading or opening the paper as a PDF file).

3. Review deadline (hard) is December 20, 2016.
The Program Committee will be making some preliminary decisions immediately after this date,
so it is highly important that we receive your complete reviews by this time.
Of course, earlier reviews are much appreciated.

4. Review guidelines and considerations
Please take the time to read the Late-Breaking Report and to write a thoughtful
and constructive review.  Remember that the authors have put considerable
time into their papers. Their effort and results deserve a fair reading.
Be considerate in your writing.
Try to identify positive as well as negative points to improve the work.
Help the authors improve the work such that it could be accepted by the HRI
Conference for either 2016 or in the future.
Expectations and criteria for the review process are expanded below.

# EXPECTATIONS FOR HRI 2016 REVIEWING

Your primary responsibility as a HRI LBR 2017 reviewer is to provide clear feedback
such that submissions can be accepted for this conference, or improved for acceptance
at future conferences. While reviewing, please keep into account the nature of LBR
submissions which are work in progress. Therefore some work may not be fully mature
 or simply be conceptual in nature. We encourage novel and thought provoking HRI research.
 While this feedback includes a judgment on acceptance, improving the quality of work
 in the community through constructive feedback is valued over reviewing for purely
 quality control. Given the interdisciplinary nature of HRI, it is critical that your
 review both helps the chairs form an excellent program and inspires authors of rejected
 papers to improve and resubmit to HRI in the future. Towards this goal, reviewers
 for HRI have the following responsibilities:

Evaluating the technical quality of the submission and the significance of its contributions to HRI,
Keeping submissions confidential,
Providing reviews in a timely manner,
Authoring reviews that are concrete and informative for the LBR chairs and constructive and actionable for the authors.

Reviews that do not meet these requirements may be deemed as unjustified and dismissed by the Program Committee

Thanks again.
