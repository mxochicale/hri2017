\section{Introduction}
Recently, NAO \cite{Gouaillier2009}, a humanoid robot, has successfully been used 
both as a fitness coach for elderly and as a rehabilitation instructor for children.
For instance, the work of Gorer \textit{et al.} \cite{Gorer2016} 
takes advantage of an RGB-D camera to extract joint angles of a human demonstrator and participants 
in order to compute the vector of absolute differences between the two entities. 
The absolute difference vector is then used to create a corrective feedback for the movement
of the elderly  with regard to (i) speed adjustment, (ii) amplitude adjustment, (iii) mirroring detection
, and (iv) motion.
However, when participants are seated the RGB-D camera cannot provide correct skeleton information.
Also there is room for implementation of a detailed scoring 
of human-robot motion imitation which can be used as a metric on how close the participant mimics the original movement 
of the robot.
Similarly, Guneysu \textit{et al.} \cite{Guneysu2015} investigated the use of NAO
as a instructor for children arm rehabilitation. 
In this case the work of Guneysu \textit{et al.} takes advantage of 
Inertial sensors in order to avoid obstructions between the robot and the children.
However,  it turns out that each of the four physiotherapists has its own way to move
which is reflected in the differences of frequency and amplitude of the movements
as well as the initial positions of the hands of the therapists.
Therefore, for this study, we advocate the use of inertial sensors to avoid the obstructions when using RGB-D cameras 
\cite{Gorer2016} and proposing a framework based on a non-linear dynamic technique 
in order to quantify human-robot motion imitation 
and to explore the similarity of movements across participants.



% For our exploration purposes of movement variability, we adopt the Sequence-Base Model
% in which the movement sequences are created by the teacher and the pupils
% reproduce it in the same way.
% It is important to note that the teaching methodology is the same but the movements performed
% by users were completely different between sessions.
% However, there is no analysis about the quantification of the quality of the
% improvement of the movements as children performed in each of the three sessions 
% but only a score for accommodation that is a ratio between the number of times when robot shows and asks
% for a motion of the user \cite{Ros2014}.





% 
% 
% 
% Chen et al. proposed a tennis swing training using accelerometer sensors which classifies 
% four categories of motion 
% (correct forehand swings, only swing wrist, arm unstretchable and racket is not vertical) 
% with a ID3 inductive learning algorithm \cite{Chen2010}.







\section{METHODS}

\subsection{Research Questions}

Can the use inertial sensors attached  
both to a humanoid-robot and to a human in order to quantify the human-robot motion imitation?
% with different participants performing different simple movements?
% How the variability of a movement can be related to the dexterity of the performance
% of such movement?


\subsection{Hypotheses}
With this preliminary study, we expect to generate an intuitive 
explanation of the problem of measurement of human-robot motion imitation 
in order to provide metrics
reagarding the extend to which 
a participant can imitate the original movement.
% In the same vein
% which 
% at the same time can help us to establish the base line of movements
% to quantify the variability accross partipants and between movements.
%   can be linked with the leve dexterity of users and more 
%   importantly provide feedback to move better.


% the human-robot motion imitation. 



\subsection{Participants}
Twelve healthy participants (two females and nine males)
mean age 19.5$\pm$0.79 (from now on abbreviated as p01 to p12) were invited to 
participate in this study. All the participants were right handed.
The design of the experiment was approved by University of XXX ethics approval
process. All participants provided informed consent forms prior to participation.



\subsection{Procedure}
Participants were asked to imitate two simple arm movements: (i) 
horizontal movement and (ii) vertical movement;
such simple movements were performed by NAO and each movement were repeated ten times
for both the robot and the participant.
Data were then collected at a sampling rate of 50Hz from two NeMEMSi inertial sensors
which provide tri-axial data of accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer sensors and
quaternions \cite{Comotti2014}. Inertial sensors were attached to the right 
hand of the robot and the right hand of the participant.
Due to the simplicity of the proposed movements  in this study, 
we focus our analysis on the $z$ axis from the gyroscope sensor ($g_z$) 
which is mostly affected by the nature of the horizontal movement 
(Figure~\ref{fig:main}-A).

\subsection{Framework for the study}

Due to the non-linear structure of the time-series 
which creates different periods and amplitudes 
between repetitions of movements and also different time-series across participants
(Figure~\ref{fig:main}-B,C), we use the time-delay embedding
as our main method for this study in order to measure the human-robot motion imitation.
The method of time-delay embedding is essentially an array of 
time delayed copies of the available time series $x(n)$ and is defined as  
$ \overline{x}(n) = \{  x(n), x(n-\tau), x(n-2\tau), \dots,x(n-(m-1)\tau)\}$
where $m$ is the embedding dimension and $\tau$ is the delay embedding \cite{Huke2006}.
We applied PCA ($PC_1, PC_2, \dots, PC_m$) to $ \overline{x}(n)$
in order to obtain the reconstructed state space 
using the first two principal components $PC_1$ and $PC_2$ (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-D,E and F).
We then computed euclidean distances from (0,0) point to each 
point ($PC_1(i),PC_2(i)$) where ($1 \leq i \leq m$)
in order to obtain the box-and-whisker plots (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-G)
for each participant.




\section{PRELIMINARY RESULTS}

On one hand, it is expect that the robot performs very similar repetitions of movements 
which are visualised in the orange time-series (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-B and C). 
Therefore, a tight circular  shape of the reconstructed state space (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-D)
is linked with little interquartile range of the respective box-and-whisker plot  (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-G).
On the other hand, 
the time-series of participant 05 shows (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-C)
 different amplitude and periods per repetitions which
are related to the disjointed shape of 
the reconstructed state space (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-F) and therefore 
linked with a maximum interquartile range in the  box-and-whisker plots  (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-G).
We also show that participant 01 is an example of a good imitator of the robot movement
(Figure~\ref{fig:main}-B,E and G).
It is important to note that due to the reduced space for the report, we are only presented
the results for the horizontal arm movement.

\section{FUTURE WORK}

We can conclude that the proposed framework efficiently captured the imitating capabities of the participants.
However, our main concern when quantifying human-robot motion imitation
is the lack of metrics to say who can be considered a bad, intermediate or good imitator.
Therefore, there are four areas that we are going to investigate in the following year
(i) data collection from a wider range of individuals (gender and age)
and from additional inertial sensors attached to the body.
(ii) explore complex movements which can be performed by both NAO and humans
(iii) undertake a wider review of non-linear techniques that can be used for 
the assessment of human-robot motion imitation, and
(iv) explore the use of convolutional neural networks for automatic 
classification of the levels of human-robot motion imitation.
