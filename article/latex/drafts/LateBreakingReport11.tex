\section{Introduction}
Recently, NAO, a humanoid robot, has successfully been used either as a fitness coach for elderly 
or as an instructor of rehabilitation for children.
For instance, G{\"{o}}rer \textit{et al.} used NAO as an exercise tutor
and Asus Xtion RGB-D camera to extract joint angles of a human demonstrator and participants \cite{Gorer2016}.
% in order tocompute the absolute differences between them \cite{Gorer2016}. Such absolute differences
Absolute differences of joint angles between the human demonstrator and participatns
are used to create a corrective feedback for the movement of the elderly 
with respect to (i) speed adjustment, (ii) amplitude adjustment, (iii) mirroring detection, and (iv) motion.
However, on one hand, when participants are seated the RGB-D camera cannot provide correct skeleton information
of the participant,
and, on the other hand, there is room for implementation of a detailed scoring of human-robot imitation
since the score is only based on how well the participant follows the verbal commands of the robot.
Similarly, Guneysu \textit{et al.} used NAO and wearable inertial sensors
to monitor motions of arm rehabilitation of children \cite{Guneysu2015}.
The challenge for Guneysu \textit{et al.} is to keep the children's motivation in order to imitate 
movements for arm rehabilitation therapy. 
For this, NAO successfully captures the attention of children,
while the use of inertial sensors is ideal to avoid any  
obstructions between the children, the therapist, and  the robot.
% in their previous study they used Kinect sensor
% to compute joint angles of motion but when therapists interact with children they obstruct 
% the kinect sensor to which inertial sensors were used in order 
% to avoid obstructions between the children, the therapist and  the robot.
However, as part of their study, it turns out that four physiotherapists have their own way to move
while performing
% when they were asked to perform the 
arm motions
which is reflected in the differences of frequency and amplitude of the movements
as well as in the initial positions of the hands.

For this study, we are therefore proposing a framework based on the state space reconstruction 
in order to explore a metric that can help us to determine 
% how to  analyse the data collected from inertial
% sensors attached both to a humanoid-robot and to a person
% in order to quantify 
how close the participants mimic the original movement of the robot.
We also use inertial sensors to avoid any obstructions during the interaction 
and NAO to control simple movements that participants have to imitate.

% Similarly,

% measure human-robot imitation 
% and to explore the similarity of movements across participants.


% which can be used as a metric on how close the participant mimics the original movement 
% of the robot.



% For our exploration purposes of movement variability, we adopt the Sequence-Base Model
% in which the movement sequences are created by the teacher and the pupils
% reproduce it in the same way.
% It is important to note that the teaching methodology is the same but the movements performed
% by users were completely different between sessions.
% However, there is no analysis about the quantification of the quality of the
% improvement of the movements as children performed in each of the three sessions 
% but only a score for accommodation that is a ratio between the number of times when robot shows and asks
% for a motion of the user \cite{Ros2014}.

% Chen et al. proposed a tennis swing training using accelerometer sensors which classifies 
% four categories of motion 
% (correct forehand swings, only swing wrist, arm unstretchable and racket is not vertical)

\subsection{Participants}
Twelve right-handed healthy participants (two females and ten males)
mean age 19.5$\pm$0.79 (from now on abbreviated as p01 to p12) were invited to 
participate in this study. 
All participants provided informed consent forms prior to participation.
The design of the experiment was approved by University of Birmingham ethics approval
process. 


% 
\subsection{Procedure}
Participants were asked to imitate horizontal and vertical arm movements
performed by NAO.
Such simple movements were repeated ten times for both the participant and the robot
 in a front to front imitation activity
 to which
 wearable inertial sensors were attached the right hand of the participant and to the left hand of the robot
(Figure~\ref{fig:main}-A).
Data were then collected at a sampling rate of 50Hz with two NeMEMSi inertial sensors
which provide tri-axial data of accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer sensors and
quaternions \cite{Comotti2014}. 

% Because of the , 
% i
It is important to note that due to the reduced space, we are only presented
results for the horizontal movement and 
we focus our analysis on the $z$ axis from the gyroscope sensor ($g_z$) 
which is mostly affected by the nature of the horizontal movement (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-A).

% Due to the simplicity of the proposed movements  in this study, 
% (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-A).






\section{State Space reconstruction}

% We propose to use the 
% to quantify human-robot imitation.
The State Space Reconstruction (SSR) is based on the methods of time-delay embedding and PCA \cite{Gibson1992}.
% \cite{Huke2006}.
% which mainly increase the dimensionally of the data, 
% $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$,
% then a further transformation is considered,
% $\mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$, 
% which for our study is PCA due to its non-parametric feature.
Our motivation to use the method of time-delay embedding
is due to the non-linear structure of the time-series
which is 
% Such non-linear structure is 
presented 
as
% with 
different periods and amplitudes of the time-series 
between repetitions of movements and across movements of participants (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-B,C).
% Similarly, we use 
% , we use the time-delay embedding
% as our main method for this study in order to measure the human-robot motion imitation.
The method of time-delay embedding is an array of %time
delayed copies of the available time series $x(n)$ and is defined as  
$ \overline{x}(n) = \{  x(n), x(n-\tau), x(n-2\tau), \dots,x(n-(m-1)\tau)\}$
where $m$ is the embedding dimension and $\tau$ is the delay embedding.
PCA is used as a method for dimensionality reduction due to its non-parametric feature.
PCA is therefore applied to $ \overline{x}(n)$ in order to get $PC_1, PC_2, \dots, PC_m$ 
to which we use $PC_1$ and $PC_2$ 
to create a state space reconstruction (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-D,E and F).
Finally, we computed euclidean distances in the state space 
from (0,0) point to each ($PC_1(i),PC_2(i)$) point where $1 \leq i \leq m$
in order to obtain the box-and-whisker plots for each participant (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-G).


\section{PRELIMINARY RESULTS}


% 
% We want to emphasise that the use of the SSR
% % time-delay embedding method in order to characterise the non-linearities of the time-series 
% % and the use of PCA as a tool for dimensionality reduction 
% is useful to quantify how close participants 
% imitate the original movement from the robot.


On one hand, it is expect that the robot performed very similar repetitions of movements 
which are visualised in the orange time-series (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-B,C)
and therefore produced a tight circular shape in the reconstructed state space (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-D).
On the other hand, 
different amplitude and period of the time-series for participant 05 (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-C)
are related to a disjointed circular shape of the reconstructed state space (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-F).
Such shapes in the reconstructed state space 
are linked either 
to a maximum interquartile range in the  box-and-whisker plot 
or 
to a little interquartile range of the respective box-and-whisker plot (Figure~\ref{fig:main}-G).

\section{CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK}
We proposed a metric to quantify how close a participant can imitate a robot for simple arm
movements to which it can be noted that the proposed metric reveals that participants show different ranges 
of imitation which can be linked to a scoring of human-robot imitation.
However, our main concerns when quantifying human-robot imitation
is the lack of metrics to say who can be considered a bad, intermediate or good imitator.

For future work, there are four areas that we are going to investigate:
(i) data collection from a wider range of individuals (gender, age and healthy and unhealthy)
and from additional inertial sensors attached to the body,
(ii) explore complex movements which can be performed by both persons and NAO,
(iii) undertake a wider review of non-linear techniques that can be used for 
the assessment of human-robot imitation, and, 
(iv) explore the use of convolutional neural networks for automatic 
classification of the levels of human-robot imitation.
