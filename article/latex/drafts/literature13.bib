@article{Huke2006,
abstract = {The embedding theorem of Takens forms a birdge between the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems and the analysis of experimental time series. This memorandum describes the theorem, and gives a detailed account of its proof. The necessary differential topology is briefly reviewed, and then a proof of the theorem is presented; this proof follows broadly the argument of takens, although it differs in some details. Some extensions to the theorem, which facilitate its use in applications, are described. The memo concludes with a brief discussion of what the theorem implies about time series, viewed as the raw material for signal processing algorithms.},

@article{Gouaillier2009,
abstract = {This article presents the mechatronic design of the autonomous humanoid robot called NAO that is built by the French company Aldebaran-Robotics. With its height of 0.57 m and its weight about 4.5 kg, this innovative robot is lightweight and compact. It distinguishes itself from existing humanoids thanks to its pelvis kinematics design, its proprietary actuation system based on brush DC motors, its electronic, computer and distributed software architectures. This robot has been designed to be affordable without sacrificing quality and performance. It is an open and easy-to-handle platform. The comprehensive and functional design is one of the reasons that helped select NAO to replace the AIBO quadrupeds in the 2008 RoboCup standard league.},

@article{Fung2008,
abstract = {In this paper, we examined the implementation of two off-the-shelf humanoid robots for the demonstration and training of Thai folk dances. One is based on a low cost robot, "RS Media" by by WowWee. It has a recommended retail price (RRP) of USD300. The other robot is the "SPC-101C" from Speecys Corp. SPC-101C's RRP is about ten times of RS Media. The objective is to determine the appropriateness of these two robots for use in the training and demonstration of Thai dance movements. The paper presents results from an initial investigation. The SPC-101C is more flexible and has more advanced functions. Interestingly, it was observed that some of the movements are better on the cheaper robot. However, the faster response and advanced interactivity of SPC-101C definitely has greater potential for more complex movements and advanced applications.},

@article{Michalowski2007,
abstract = {This paper describes a robotic system that uses dance as a form of social interaction to explore the properties and im? portance of rhythmic movement in general social interaction. The system consists of a small creature-like robot whose movement is controlled by a rhythm-based software system. Environmental rhythms can be extracted from auditory or visual sensory stimuli, and the robot synchronizes its move? ment to a dominant rhythm. The system was demonstrated, and an exploratory study conducted, with children interact? ing with the robot in a generalized dance task. Through a behavioral analysis of videotaped interactions, we found that the robot's synchronization with the background music had an effect on children's interactive involvement with the robot. Furthermore, we observed a number of expected and unexpected styles and modalities of interactive exploration and play that inform our discussion on the next steps in the design of a socially rhythmic robotic system.},

@article{Tsuchida2013,
abstract = {Collapsed formation in a group dance will greatly reduce the quality of the performance even if the dance in the group is synchronized with music. Therefore, learning the formation of a dance in a group is as important as learning its choreog-raphy. However, if someone cannot participate in practice, it is difficult for the rest of the members to gain a sense of the proper formation in practice. We propose a practice-support system for performing the formation smoothly us-ing a self-propelled screen even if there is no dance partner. We developed a prototype of the system and investigated whether a sense of presence provided by both methods of practicing formations was close to the sense we really ob-tain when we dance with humans. The result verified that the sense of dancing with a projected video was closest to the sense of dancing with a dancer, and the trajectory infor-mation from dancing with a self-propelled robot was close to the trajectory information from dancing with a dancer. Practicing in situations similar to real ones is able to be done by combining these two methods. Furthermore, we investigated whether the self-propelled screen obtained the advantages of dancing with both methods and found that it only obtained advantages of dancing with projected video.},

@article{Chen2010,
abstract = {In this paper, a movement-training system aiming to classify motions for physical education is proposed and analyzed. Traditional physical education requires an instructor teaching exercise movement individually. Teaching every student in a big class demands considerable time and efforts. Utilization of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) becomes pervasive in e-learning trend. However, CAI is often confined in literal form course such as mathematics and language courses. It is necessary to develop a motiontraining system for physical education. In this paper, we develop a low-cost motion capture with Wii Remote Control (Wiimote) for training movement exercise, such as tennis and baseball. This system applies Wiimotes to capture acceleration of each part of limbs. Each Wiimote is attached to the limb which then sends back the acceleration information to the computer via Bluetooth wireless link. After gathering the acceleration data of multiple limbs' parts, the computer recognizes the motion and classifies the motion to several correct and incorrect categories. As a result, it is able to provide the appropriate advice to the students. The system applies a modified ID3 inductive learning to generate a decision tree with continuous-valued attributes. We develop an easy-to-use GUI interface for coaches. The results show that the average accuracy of classification is 83{\%}. The system reduces the workload of the coach and improves teaching and learning performance. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
